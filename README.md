# Face Recognition Application

This project is a simple face recognition application built using **Node.js**, **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **FaceAPI.js** with pre-trained models. It identifies and matches faces in images uploaded by the user and compares them to stored images.

## üåü Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces from images using the `ssd_mobilenetv1` model.
- **Face Recognition**: Matches the detected faces with stored images in a folder.
- **Landmark Detection**: Identifies facial landmarks using pre-trained models.
- **Accuracy**: High accuracy in recognizing faces due to pre-trained models.
- **Client-Side Execution**: Runs entirely in the browser, without backend processing.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### **Frontend**:
- **HTML5, CSS3**: For building the user interface.
- **JavaScript (Node.js)**: For implementing client-side logic.
- **FaceAPI.js**: For face detection, recognition, and landmark analysis.

### **Pre-Trained Models**:
- `ssd_mobilenetv1`: For face detection.
- `face_landmark_68`: For facial landmark detection.
- `face_recognition`: For face recognition and matching.
